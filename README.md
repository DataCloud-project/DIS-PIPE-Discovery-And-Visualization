# DIS-PIPE-Discovery-And-Visualization
It employs process mining algorithms enhanced with artificial intelligence solutions to efficiently build the sequence flow and to learn all data flows and event-based conditions during their execution. In addition, it integrates the discovered pipelines with DEF-PIPE through user-friendly visual workbenches, such as flowcharts, statistics, and dashboards.
DIS-PIPE-Discovery-And-Visualization component provides a graphical user interface for importing event logs in the IEEE Standard for eXtensible Event Stream format and executing the functionalities by leveraging a drag-and-drop workbench.
